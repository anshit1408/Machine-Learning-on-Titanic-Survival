# Machine-Learning-on-Titanic-Survival
Analysis of what sort of people were most likely to survive one of the biggest ship wrecks in history using various Machine Learning algorithms.
## Software requirement
* Python 2.7
## How to run
* Just run the MLTitanicProject.py file and we will see different graphs showing comparision of different categories and comparision of different algos.
## Ouptut graphs

* Class vs Survival
* Siblings vs Survived
* Parent-child relationship vs Survived
* Age vs Survived
* Cabin vs Survived
 ## Algorithms used
 * Logistic Regression
 * Gauss Naive Bayes
 * SVM
 * Decision tree
 * Random Forest
 * KNN
